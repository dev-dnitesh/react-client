# 5 features of VS-CODE

# 1). Intellisense

IntelliSense is code auto-complete meets artificial intelligence. This utility provides a list of suggestions along with a short hint or description as we are writing codes. These is derived from several contextual factors such as the programming language, the syntax, the variables, the functions as well as all the codes within the file.

# 2). Peek


While coding, you may often forget a particular function, where the function is initially defined, and what are the required parameters.

With Peek, you can select a function then hit Shift + F12. The selection expands into an inline window showing the complete definition of the function as well as where the function is defined. The feature currently works in C, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, .NET, and a few other programming languages.


# 3). CLI


Similar to SublimeText with its subl command line, Visual Studio Code is equipped a CLI named code and it is easy to install.

In Windows, the CLI will have already been installed along with the app. The CLI is accessible through the Command Prompt. In OS X, it can be installed and uninstalled through the Command Palette.

You can use the CLI to open a particular directory to Visual Studio Code, or open your current project directory in Terminal or Command Prompt directly from the editor.

# 4). Built-in Git


Visual Studio Code has Git built right in the editor. On the left of the sidebar, you will find the Git icon where you can initialize Git as well as perform several Git commands such as commit, pull, push, rebase, publish, and look into the changes within the file.

In addition, if you are making changes on a Git repository, the Visual Studio will show color indicators in the code editor gutter, indicating where you have made the modifications.


# 5). Task Runner


Last but not least, Visual Studio Code also has a built-in Task Runner, which provides some level of convenience.

To use this feature, we can either set a tasks.json file or through some popular Task configuration like Grunt, Gulp, or MSBuild if provided. Once the configuration is set, we can run the Task Runner through the Command Palette by typing Run Task. Typing Tasks will list all related commands.

# 8 useful plugins of VS-CODE

# 1). GitLens.


GitLens simply helps you better understand code. Quickly glimpse into who changed a line or code block, why, and when. Jump back through history to gain further insights into how and why the code evolved. Effortlessly explore the history and evolution of a code base. It is powerful, feature-rich, and highly customizable to meet your needs.


# 2). Live Share.


At the moment, when doing pair programming, the regular practice is to share the screen via Zoom or any other provider. If you have tried that, you know its flaws. There’s a lot of room for improvement. This plugin aims to fill this gap.

This plugin will let you do pair programming remotely. It currently supports up to 30 people. It is feature-packed. You don’t even need to jump on a Zoom call anymore. This plugin provides a built-in chat or build-in audio calls.


# 3). VS Code Remote Development.


This extension provides seamless development in containers remotely on physical or virtual machines. You don’t need to run anything on the server. Just SSH to the machine using this extension.


# 4). Peacock.

Do you switch between different projects often? This extension will help you customize each project so you can have some visual feedback on what you are currently working on.


# 5). Bracket Pair Colorizer 2.


This is a very simple yet very useful extension. It allows matching brackets to be identified with colors. The user can define which characters to match and which colors to use.

It has a lot of configuration options that are worth checking out.


# 8). Prettier.


An extension to support Prettier, which is an opinionated code formatter. It removes all original styling and ensures that all outputted code conforms to a consistent style.

This tool is definitely a must on big projects so you can ensure a readable codebase. As Prettier is highly configurable, all your team needs to do is agree on its config.

You will need to tell VS Code where the .prettierrc configuration file lives or have it in the root folder.
